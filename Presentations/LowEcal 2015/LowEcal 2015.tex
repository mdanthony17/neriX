\textbf{Measurement of the Light and Charge Yield of Low Energy Nuclear Recoils in Liquid Xenon at Different Electric Fields}

Liquid xenon detectors continue to lead in the search for the direct detection of dark matter.  Still, very few measurements have studied the response of liquid xenon to low-energy nuclear recoils ($\leq 10$ keV) at different applied electric fields.  The neriX detector at Columbia University is a dual-phase time projection chamber that is optimized for simultaneous measurements of light and charge from these low-energy interactions.  A coincidence technique is employed to extract the light and charge yields from nuclear recoils in liquid xenon as a function of energy deposited and applied electric field.  In this talk, we will discuss preliminary results of the light and charge yield measurements.
