        <h1>Channels->Add..</h1>
        <p>
            Brings up a dialog to prompt for a new channel to add
            to the table.  Note that at present, there is no known way
            to programmatically enumerate the set of available channels.
            You must therefore type in the name of the channel (which is
            case sensitive).  Checking the "Add To Plot" checkbutton
            causes the channel to also be added to the set of plotted
            channels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Click <b>Ok</b> to add the channel and <b>Cancel</b> to make no
            changes.  If changes are made, the file <em>failsafechannels.txt</em>
            is written and can be used to recover the configuration if you forget
            to save the modified configuration prior to program exit
