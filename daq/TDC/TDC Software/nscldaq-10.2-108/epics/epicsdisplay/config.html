        <h1>Configuration Files</h1>
        <p>
            The epicsdisplay program requires a configuration file.  The configuration file
            is an ordinary text files.  Each line of the file can be either a channel specification
            or a comment line.  Comment lines have a pound symbol (#) as the first character
            and are ignored by the software.  Channel lines begin with the name of the
            channel followed by commentary information.  The commentary information
            can contain special keywords that are interpreted by the  program.
        </p>
        <h2>Special comment keywords</h2>
        <p>
            Special comment keywords on channel definition lines are interpreted as follows
            by the program:
            <ul>
                <li><b>plot</b>The channel is added to the strip chart
                    recorder below the table.</li>
                <li><b>nominal</b>Introduces a clause that describes the nominal
                    value window for a channel.  When a channel has a value
                    outside the nominal value it is said to be in the alarm state.
                    see the <b>alarmactions</b> keyword below.  The nominal window
                    clause has two forms:<br />
                    <pre>nominal:range[%]</pre><br />
                    and <br />
                    <pre>nominal+upper[%]-lower[%]</pre> <br />
                    The first form represents a symmetric interval about the <em>nominal</em>
                    value.  The <em>range</em> value is either the half width of the interval
                    or, if an optional percent (%) symbol is appended, the <em>range</em> value
                    represents a half width of the interval expressed as a percentage of the
                    nominal value.<br />
                    The second form represents an asymmetric interval about the <em>nominal</em>
                    The <em>upper</em> represents the width of the interval above
                    <em>nominal</em> while <em>lower</em> represents the width of
                    the interval below the <em>nominal</em>. Once again, appending a
                    percent symbol (%) changes the value to a percentage of the nominal value.
                </li>
                <li><b>alarmactions</b> introduces a set of actions to take when the channel is in
                    the alarm state.  The allowed actions are any of the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>beep</b> The application periodically beeps when the
                            channel is in the alarm state.</li>
                        <li><b>popup</b> A popup window is displayed whenthe alarm
                            occurs.</li>
                        <li><b>page</b> The channel is added to the alarm page.  The alarm</li>
                        <li><b>color=<em>spec</em></b>The channel background color is set to
                            <em>spec</em> when it is in the alarmed state.  In this case,
                            <em>spec</em> is any legitimate color specification.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
