/*! \class CScalerBank   
           CLASS_PACKAGE
           Encapsulates a scaler bank.  Scaler banks
           are objects that readout an ordered list of scalers.
           They are like ReadOrder objects, but they supply
           an {\em additional} Read member that can read data
           into an ordinary UShort_t* buffer rathern than into
           one of the specialized NSCL data buffer types.
