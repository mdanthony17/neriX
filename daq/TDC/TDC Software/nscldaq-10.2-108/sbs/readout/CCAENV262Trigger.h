/*!
  The CAEN V262 I/O module can be used to provide external
  triggers to the data taking sytsem.  This is normally used
  to create event triggers however if you want to use it to issue
  scaler triggers, knock yourself out, it's not illegal and should
  even work.

  The module should be used as follows:
  - NIM IN         0, is used to indicate a trigger,
  - NIM Pulsed out 3, is used to acknowledge the receipt of the trigger.

  since the NIM inputs are not latched, trigger in (NIM 0) must be 
  externally latched until the NIM Pulsed out 3  is seen, or else the trigger
  will be missed.  This is normally done with a gate and delay generator in
  latch mode.  The Master.Live trigger starts the gate generator, whose
  output goes to NIM In 0, the NIM pulsed out 3 is then cabled to the
  gate generator's stop input.
