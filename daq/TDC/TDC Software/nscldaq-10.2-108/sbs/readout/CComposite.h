/*!
  This class extends the object base class to support composite objects.
  A composite object is simply an object that contains other objects.
  The other objects are contained in an ordered container.
  The container is optimized for sequential reference, rather than
  for insertion/removal, as in the NSCLDAQ system, sequential reference is
  the time critical operation.

  \note This class is not abstract but it is also not very functional.
        It only implements the mechanics of the composite, it is up to 
	subclasses to implement any useful functionality for the objects
	and composites.
