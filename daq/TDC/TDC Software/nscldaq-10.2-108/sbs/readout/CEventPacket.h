   This class defines an event segment that is encapsulated in a
   documented packet.  This eases the burden of creating documented packets
   and gets the packetization logic right.
   Layering as well as inheritence are used.  The class is derived from and event
   segment, however it operates by containing both an event segment and a
   documentd packet.
