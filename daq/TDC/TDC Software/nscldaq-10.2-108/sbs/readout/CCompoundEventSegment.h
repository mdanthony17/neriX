  CCompound event segment is a CEventSegment that is also a Composite.
  The composite class is inherited but re-exposed via a type-safe adaptor
  that ensures we can only contain other event segments.

  The CEventSegment interface visits all of the contained elements
  and delegates to them sequentially.

  Since this is a CEventSegment, we can put other compound event segments
  into us providing a hierarchical assembly of event segments.
