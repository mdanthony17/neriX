   This is the base class of anything that can trigger anything else.
   Triggers are intended to be used inside of polling loops in the trigger thread.
   Triggers get periodically asked if they have fired and, if so the
   trigger loop dispatches to the appropriate action.

   \note This class is an abstract base class.  All concrete classes must at least
         override and implement oeprator() the function call operator that checks
	 the trigger condition.
