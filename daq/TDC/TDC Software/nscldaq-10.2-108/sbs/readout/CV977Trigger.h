/*!
   The CAEN V977 is an coincidence/pattern register.  This class implements a trigger
   module using that device.  The first input of the device is used as a trigger.
   That bit is echoed at hardware speeds on the corresponding output, and is cleared
   once the trigger is acknowledged.  This is slightly different than the 
   CAEN V977 trigger used in the 8.1 version of NSCLDAQ..where that bit is the busy bit
   for a combined trigger/status module.
   The clear in this case ensures that the module is able to accept a new trigger.

   See the busy status module class associated with the V977 for information about how
   to use it as a dead-time register.
