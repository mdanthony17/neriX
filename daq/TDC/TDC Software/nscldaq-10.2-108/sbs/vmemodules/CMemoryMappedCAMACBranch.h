/*!
   The important set of CAMAC interfaces we deal with are memory mapped..
   that is they occupy some space in VME memory, and an operation
   on a B,C,N,A,F (bcnaf) can be reduced to a memory read or write to the
   corresponding memory location.   Sample controllers are the
   CES CBD8210 (being phased out but still in use), and the
   Wiener CC32/VC32 board set.

   This base class implements all the dataway operations (not qtest nor
   xtest) in terms of a pure virtual function that provides the
   address represented by a bcnaf.

   \note that controllers can be either 16 or 32 bit wide.
