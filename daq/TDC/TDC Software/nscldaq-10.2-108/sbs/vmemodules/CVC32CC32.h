/*!
   The Wiener VC32/CC32 is a board set that allows
   a single CAMAC crate to be attached to a single
   VME module.  It's advantages are that it runs quite a bit faster than
   the CES CBD 8210, the cable is much less delicate, each crate uses
   a smaller address space, it has a 32 bit data path, and finally,
   it's being made, while the CES modules are out of production for quite
   some time.

   The controller is a memory mapped controller, so this is a concrete subclass
   of CMemoryMappedCAMACBranch
