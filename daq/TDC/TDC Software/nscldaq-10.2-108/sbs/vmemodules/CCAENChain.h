/*!
   This class allows the user to compose a set of modules into a 
   chain for CBLT readout.  The CBLT readout support allows a set of 
   crate contiguous modules to be readout in a unit.  As each module
   finishes presenting the data associated with an event, it uses the
   IRQ/IACK daisy chain to pass control on to the next module.  This makes
   large systems amenable to block mode readout (and that's what this class
   sets up).
   
   Chains consist of a start card (left most module in the chain), an
   end card (right most module in the chain) and a set of intermediate cards
   which must not skip any slots, and must live to the right of the
   start card and to the left of the end card.

   Sample good chain for a crate:
   \verbatim

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |S I I I E x x x x|
   +-----------------+
 
   S - Start card
   I - Intermediate card
   E - End card
   x - Don't care
   - - Empty slot.

   \endverbatim

   Sample invalid chains:

   \verbatim

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |S I - I E x x x x|
   +-----------------+

   Empty slot in the middle of a chain.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |I S I I E x x x| 
   +---------------+
 
   Intermediate card not in between Start and End cards.

   \endverbatim

   In general, if you have a system of geographical addressing, you won't
   need to worry about this, just plug the cards in and designate to the
   constructor the range of slots you'll be using.

   If you don't have slot addressable cards, you'll have to be sure that the
   std::vector of base addresses you supply really corresponds to a valid chain
   or errors will occur.
