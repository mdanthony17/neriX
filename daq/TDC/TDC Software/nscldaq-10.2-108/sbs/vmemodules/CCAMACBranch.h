   This is an abstract base class for a VME module
   that manages at least one CAMAC crate.
   The concept is that this is the device dependent part
   of a CAMAC subsystem.  CAMAC modules delegate operations
   on their modules to some instance of a concrete class derived
   from this and therefore can be independent of the actual
   controller (e.g. CES or Wiener VC/CC32).

   \note This is a pure abstract base class.
