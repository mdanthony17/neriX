   Construct a chain.  The chain can consist either of a
   set of slots defined by [nFirstSlot, nLastSlot] or it can
   consist of a set of cards described by a vector of base addresses
   Note that chains must either be entirely geographically addressed
   or physically addressed.  This is a software restriction.
   
   \param nFirstSlot (int in):
      The first geographical address in the chain. If the
      geo is true, this represents a physical slot, otherwise a
      virtual slot that is programmed into the chain members.
   \param nLastSlot (int in):
      The last geographical address in the chain.  If the geo
      parameter is true, this represents a physical slot, otherwise
      a virtual slot that is programmed into the chain members.
   \param vBases (vector<uint32_t>& in):
      A set of base addresses for the modules in the chain.
      This is only important in the geo parameter is false.
      In that case, there must be nLastSlot - nFirstSlot + 1 entries
      in the vector that represent the base addresses at which
      the non-geographical modules live.
   \param nCrate (int in default = 0):
      Identifies the vme crate in which the chain lives.  Chains
      may not span VME crates.  This is a hardware restriction.
   \param geo (bool [in]):
      - true  - The modules are adressed geographicall, and the 
                nBases parameter is effectively ignored.
     -  false - The modules are addressed by the base addresses
                in vBases and the geographical addresses are just
		programmed into the modules as virtual slots.
   \throw string
      A descriptive error message should there be any problems 
      creating the chain.  The CAENmodules created up to that 
      point will be properly destroyed if an exception is thrown.

   Turns on the EMPTY_PROG bit of the Bit2 control/status register on the right most module in the chain..
   When enabled, this bit implies that the last module in the chain will
   provide a header/trailer longword if it got a gate, if there is no data.
   This is intended to help unambiguously identify the end of data.

   The SBS PCI/VME interface has a deeply pipelined DMA engine.  It is not able
   to reliably deliver partial transfer counts for DMA that end in a BUSERR e.g.
   However, in most cases, doing a CBLT read will result in a partial transfer terminating 
   in a BUSERR.  

   If the modules in the chain all have  a common GATE, this ensures there are always
   a header/trailer from the last module in the chain, and that data can allow an
   unambiguous determination of the end of the chain data.  Typically one would use this
   by placing the data from the chain read in a packet.  Processing the data in the packet
   until the trailer from the last ADC in the chain, but using the packet word count
   to determine where the next chunk of data is.
