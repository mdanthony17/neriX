        <p>
            The <em>File->Write</em> command graphically prompts you for a
            <a href="config.html">configuration file</a>.  The current module
            identification, connection, and settings are written into this
            configuration file.  The configuration file is written such that if
            a <a href="new.html">File->New</a> selects it, the new control panel
            created would be identical in identification, connection, and loaded values
            as the one that did the File->Write.
