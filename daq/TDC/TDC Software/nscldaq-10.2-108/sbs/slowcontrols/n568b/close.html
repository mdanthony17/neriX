        <p>
            The File->Close command is used to close the control panel you are working with.
            All other control panels will continue to run.  If, however you are closing the last
            control panel, the program will exit.  Prior to closing the control panel, you will
            be prompted to ensure that you have saved any settings you may want to save from this panel
            before closing it.
