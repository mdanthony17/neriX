        <h1>The Shaper Graphical user interface.</h1>
        <p>
            The GUI of the shaper is divided into several sections.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    At the top of the gui is the menu bar. The menubar
                    contains two menus the <a href="filemenu.html">File menu</a>
                    which contains commands that read/write and manipulate
                    <a href="config.html">configuration files</a>, and the
                    <a href="helpmenu.html">Help menu</a> which allows you to
                    access the online help and program version information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Below the menu bar is the module identification area.  This
                    area displays the name you have given the shaper as well as the
                    VME crate and base address of its controller.  This area allows you
                    to distinguish between individual modules in a system with multiple
                    control panels.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Below the id bar is a frame that allows you to select and control the
                    settings of a single channel of the shaper.  This area includes
                    spinboxes, checkbuttons and a set of radio buttons.  Spinboxes can be
                    adjusted either by clicking, or holding down the left mouse button over
                    the up or down arrow of the box, or by typing a new value and hitting either
                    the <em>enter</em>, or the <em>tab</em> key.  The controls in this frame
                    have labels on their right sides and are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <em>Channel</em> Selects which channel is being controlled.  When
                            you change the channel, the current settings for the new channel are
                            loaded into the GUI.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>Coarse Gain</em>Sets the coarse gain for the currently selected channel.
                            The coarse gain is an input multiplier.  Valid values are power of two
                            up to 128 (e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>Fine Gain</em>Sets the fine-gain for the currently selected channel.
                            the fine gain is a value in arbitrary units in the range 0 through 255 inclusive.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>Pole 0 adjust</em> Sets the magnitude of the pole0 adjust of the amplifier.
                            Pole 0 adjustment is used to deal with discontinuities (poles) in the amplifier transfer
                            function. In particular, almost all amplifiers have a discontinuity about a zero
                            input.  This leads to undershoots and overshoots as the input pulse decays towards
                            zero.  The Pole 0 adjustment compensates for this effect.  The magnitude of the
                            pole 0 adjust is an arbitrary value between 0 and 255 inclusive.  If you see
                            excessive over or undershoot in the output signal relative to the input signal
                            see if adjusting this parameter improves this.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>Invert Outpout</em> Controls the output inversion.   The output polarity
                            is either inverted or the direct output of the amplifier.  This is a check box
                            that, when lit indicates the output should be inverted.
                        </li>
                        <li><em>- Polarity</em> Indicates whether or not the input signal is a positive or
                            negative signal.  If lit, the input signal is negative.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>Shaping Time</em>  This radio button set adjusts the shaping time of
                            the amplifier.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Below the channel frame, is a strip of controls for the module global settings:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <em>Common Offset (mV)</em> Controls and displays the common DC offset that will
                            be applied to the channel in mV.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>Monitor channel</em>.  The amplifier has multiplexed outputs for the
                                output and fast output.  If <em>Monitor channel</em> is lit, these will
                                reflect the outputs of the channel selected in the channel frame, usually
                                used to view output waveforms with an oscilloscope.  Note that enabling the
                                multiplexed output does cause some noise to couple to the actual outputs,
                                the CAEN manual suggests turning this output off when it is not in use.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
