        <h1>File->New... creating a new control panel</h1>
        <p>
            The File->New command prompts you graphically for a
            <a href="config.html">configuration file</a>.
            The configuration file is read in and a new control panel created to
            control the discriminator that is described by that configuration file.  If the
            file includes device settings, these are loaded into the discriminator.
