        <h1>The CAEN V812 discriminator control panel</h1>
        <p>
            The title of the window containig the CAEN V812 discriminator
            control panel is the name of the module as defined in the
            <a href="config.html">configuration file</a>.
            The CAENV812 control panel window is divided into 6 sections.
            <ul>
                <li>The top part of the control panel is taken up with the
                    menubar.  The menubar has <a href="filemenu.html">File</a>
                    and a <a href="helpmenu.html">Help</a> menu.
                </li>
                <li>Below the menubar is a line of text that identifies the
                    module.  This text provides the base address and serial number
                    of the module.
                </li>
                <li>Below the identification line is a frame that allows you to select
                    a channel of the discriminator, set its threshold, enable or disable
                    the channel.  The <b>Set All</b> copies the selected channels'
                    threshold into all the channels.
                </li>
                <li>Below the channel control frame are two frames to control the width
                    and deadtimes of banks of 8 channels.  The CAEN V812 has deadtime and
                    width values that are common to groups of 8 channels.
                </li>
                <li>Finally, at the bottom of the GUI is a controller for the Majority
                    threshold.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The controls are essentially all 'spinboxes'  A spinbox is a text entry with
            up and down arrows that allow you to modify the value.  Holding down an arrow
            repeatedly increments or decrements the value.  You may also type in a new value and
            either hit the <b>Enter</b> or <b>Tab</b> key for that value to be accepted.
