        <p>
            The File->Close command allows you to close a control panel you no longer need.
            Prior to closing the panel you are asked if you want to save the control panel.
            If you click "Yes", the functionality of the <a href="write.html">File->Write</a>
            command is executed prior to closing down the panel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the last control panel managed by the application is closed, the application
            itself will exit.
