        <p>
            The File->Write prompts you graphically for a configuration file.
            The command writes the current control panel as a
            <a href="config.html">configuration file</a>.  All device settings,
            identification and addressing information are written to the file.
        </p>
        <p>
            The configuration file can be loaded into existing control panels,
            restored at a later date into the current panel, or used as a configuration
            file on the command line that starts the program.
