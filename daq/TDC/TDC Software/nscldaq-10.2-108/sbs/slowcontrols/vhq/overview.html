        <h1>vhqControl Overview</h1>
        <p>
            The vhqControl program allows you to create and run control panels
            for an arbitrary number of iSeg VHQ 2xx modules.
        </p>
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>
            The program should be started as follows:<br /> <br />
            <pre>$DAQHOME/Scripts/ControlApplications/vhqControl.tcl [config files...]</pre><br />
            Each <a href="configfile.html">config file</a> on the command line is a configuration file
            that describes the module and optionally contains initial settings.
            If no configuration files are provided, the program will graphically prompt for one.
            Additional control panels can be created after the program is running as well.
        </p>
        <h2>Using the program</h2>
        <p>
