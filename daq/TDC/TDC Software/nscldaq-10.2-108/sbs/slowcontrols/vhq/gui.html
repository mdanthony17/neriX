        <h1>The VHQ Gui</h1>
        <p>
            The VHQ gui is divided into several sections.
            <ul>
                <li>The <a href="menubar.html">menu bar</a> provides access to commands that
                    are not directly available onthe control panel.</li>
                <li>The identification strip, just below the menu bar describes the module controlled
                    by each control panel.</li>
                <li>Below the identification strip are two <em>Channel Panels</em>  each channel panel
                    controls one channel of the VHQ module.</li>
                <li>Below the channel panels is a log window.  The log window displays a log of
                    trip conditions and trip resets. Trips are displayed in <font color="red">red</font>
                    while trip resets are displaye d in <font color="green">green</font>.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Channel panels</h2>
        <p>
            The channel panels are how you control each high voltage channel. Each channel
            panel is clearly labelled with its channel name (A or B). Displays are provided for the
            current draw in micro-Amps, as well as the voltage the channel is currently putting out.
        </p>
        <p>
            A <em>spinbox</em> allows you to set voltage targets for ramps.  Setting a voltage target
            does not actually initiate a ramp.  Ramps are initiated by clicking the <b>Ramp</b> button
            below the spinbox providing the target.  A fast ramp to 0 can be initiated by clicking the
            <b>Off</b> button.  The ramp speed is a <a href="configspeeds.html">configurable parameter</a>.
            Each channel also has a configurable <a href="configilimit.html">configurable current limit</a>.
        </p>
