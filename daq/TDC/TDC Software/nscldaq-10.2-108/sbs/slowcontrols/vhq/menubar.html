        <h1>The Menu Bar</h1>
        <p>
            The menu bar is the strip at the top of the control panel.
            The menus on the menu bar allow you to access commands that
            are not as frequently used as the device control operations.
            The menus are:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="filemenu.html">File</a>  which allows access to commands
                    that require configuration files, as well as to close control panels
                    and exit the program.</li>
                <li><a href="configmenu.html">Configure</a> which allows you to configure
                    current limits and ramp rates.</li>
                <li><a href="helpmenu.html">Help</a> which provides access to the program
                online documentation </li>
            </ul>
