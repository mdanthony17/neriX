        <h1>Configure -> Set Ramp Speeds...</h1>
        <p>
            The <b>Configure -> Set Ramp Speeds...</b> command allows
            to set the ramp speeds for each channel.  Ramp speeds
            determine how quickly each channel seeks its target
            when asked to ramp.
        </p>
        <p>
            The command pops up a modal dialog box.  The dialog box
            has a spin box for the ramp speed for each channel.
            These spinboxes are loaded with the ramp speeds in effect
            at the time the dialog is created.
            Adjust
            the speeds as desired (units are Volts/Second).  Click <b>Ok</b>
            to accept your modifications.  Click <b>Cancel</b> to retain the
            previous ramp speeds.
