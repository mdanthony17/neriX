        <h1>File -> Close</h1>
        <p>
            The <b>File -> Close</b> command closes the current control panel.
            The user is first prompted for confirmation, with a reminder that
            closing the panel will lose any unsaved changes to the panel state.
            If the user confirms that they want to close the panel, the current
            panel will be closed.  If that panel was the last running control panel,
            the application exits.
