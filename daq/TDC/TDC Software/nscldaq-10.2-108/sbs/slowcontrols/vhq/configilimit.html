        <p>
            This command allows you to modify the per channel soft current
            limits for the module.  A dialog is popped up.  The dialog is modal,
            which means that you must dismiss it before you can interact with any
            of the control panels.  Use the spinboxes in the dialog to set the
            current limits for each channel in uA.  These spinboxes are initially
            loaded with the current limits in effect at the time the dialog is
            popped up.
        </p>
        <p>
            To accept the modified current limits, click the <b>Ok</b> button.
            To retain the initial current limits, click the <b>Cancel</b> button.
