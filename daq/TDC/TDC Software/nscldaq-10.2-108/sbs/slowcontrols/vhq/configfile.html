        <h1>Configuration Files</h1>
        <p>
            The VHQ control application relies on configuration files
            to determine which modules to control and what their initial
            settings should be.  The configuration file is a Tcl script.
            The configuration file sets Tcl variables that are interpreted
            both as device identification/connection information and as
            settings.  This page describes the variables you can set.
        </p>
        <h2>Identification/connection variables</h2>
        <p>
            Identification and configuration variables supply information
            used by people and computers to locate the module:
            <ul>
                <li><b>name</b> provides an english name for the device. </li>
                <li><b>crate</b> is the number of the VME crate the device is installed in.</li>
                <li><b>base</b> is the base address of the device in the VME crate.</li>
                <li><b>maxv</b> is the maximum voltage capability of the module</li>
                <li><b>maxi</b> is the maxium current that can be sourced by the module</li>
            </ul>
            All of these variables are required to have values in configuration files.
            If a configuration file is used as a settings file, these values will be ignored
            and can be omitted.
        </p>
        <h2>Settings variables</h2>
        <p>
            Settings variables represent module settings.  When settings are loaded, the
            application never performs a ramp to a target.  Voltage ramps can only be initiated
            manually.
        </p>
        <p>
            The settings variables are:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ilimit(<em>chan</em>)</b> Defines the soft current limit for channel
                     <em>chan</em>.  This limit is expressed in uA.</li>
                <li><b>RampSpeed(<em>chan</em>)</b> Defines the ramp speed for channel
                    <em>chan</em>.  This speed is in units of Volts/sec.</li>
                <li><b>SetPoint(<em>chan</em>)</b> Defines the ramp target voltage for
                    channel <em>chan</em>.  This is in units of Volts.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
