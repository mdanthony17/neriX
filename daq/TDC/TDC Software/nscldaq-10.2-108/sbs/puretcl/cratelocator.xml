        Each system can support up to 8 SBS controllers, numbered
        <literal>0-7</literal>.  Unfortunately, there are no distinguishing
        marks on the controllers themselves to let you know which is which.

        The <command>cratelocator</command> utility presents you with a set of
        radiobuttons.  Select one to choose a VME crate controller.
        Click the <guibutton>Locate</guibutton> button.  <command>cratelocator</command>
        rapidly issues VME operations on the crate which causes the selected controller's
        <literal>Remote</literal> light to glow.  When you have identified the
        controller either click the <guibutton>Stop</guibutton> button and
        select repeat this process until all controllers have been identified, or
        click <guibutton>Exit</guibutton> to exit.

        Note that unless you add VME controllers to the system, or rearrange the
        Fiber optic cabling, VME bus controller numbers will not change from
        reboot to reboot.
