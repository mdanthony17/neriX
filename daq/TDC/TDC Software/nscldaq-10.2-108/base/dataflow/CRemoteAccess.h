class CRingBuffer;

/*!
  Provides programmatic remote access to ring buffers.
  This software allows application to gain data from rings that live in remote systems.
  Rings are specified as URIs of the form:
  tcp://hostname/ringname

  There are two major cases; local and remote rings.  A local ring is defined by
  hostname == localhost.  In that case, a client connection to the local ring is made
  via the CRingBuffer class directly.  If the hostname is not localhost, 
  Proxy rings are created with names of the form hostname.ringname.

  If hostname.ringname exists, it is assumed to be a proxy for ringname in the host
  hostname, and a CRingBuffer connection is used to directly connect to the ring.

  If hostname.ringname does not exist, the proxy ring is created and the remote system's
  RingMaster process is contacted to get a REMOTE connection started.  This is connected
  to a stdintoring process that will be run locally to inject data into the ring.
  The entire affair looks a lot like a cross system pipeline:

  remotering -> ringtostdout |network| stdintoring -> proxyring.

  The effect is for there to aggregate the transfer of data from a remote system
  to all the clients of a ring in this system.
