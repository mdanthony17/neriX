/**
 * This is an encapsulation of a thread that has some initialization that may be
 * inherently thread-unsafe.  The idea is that the start method is that we override
 * start() so that it takes out a mutex, starts the thread and then waits on a condition
 * variable tied to the thread.  The run() method is also overriddent to
 * first invoke the init() method and then signal the condition variable prior to 
 * invoking an operator() method that is the actual main body of the thread.
