Dec 16, 2010 
      - Fix error in CRingItem copy construction ... if there was a
	payload, the m_pCursor member was not being set to point to the
	end of that payload...leading the CRingItem target to think the
	item was empty.  This was also a problem with operator= which also
	used CRingItem::copyin where the problem lay.
      - Fix various copy in issues with CRingBuffer and subclasses.
	make all the tests pass that should pass and remove those that
	should no longer pass due to changes in the way sampling
	has been done.
Dec 20,2010
      - Fix error in URL parsing that made absolute file urls fail.
	(removed the leading /).
      - Fix error in Gui that prevented event file segments from
	showing up on the status strip.
Dec 31, 2010
      - In readout gui, make links between files symbolic so that they
	port across backup and restores in a different directory tree as
	happens during NSCL experiment closeout.
January 27, 2011
	- Fix up Experiment.tcl so things work on etch systems (for now).
	- Fix errors in copy construction in daq/format.
February 17, 2011	
	- Fix error in event file overwite handling in readoutgui:
	  the softlink must be deleted before being made.
	
March 10, 2011 10.0-004
	- Make ring master wait until the port manager is actually alive
	rather than dying if it isn't.
	- Install VERSION file in make install target.
	- Misc. changes to Makefile.am's and configure.ac so that
	autoreconf isn't so bitchy.
April 8 2011 10.0-005
	- Stop elapsed run timer in readout gui when the run ends.
April 13, 2011 10.0-006
	- Really get the elapsed run timer logic right ...with
	interpolation from the scaler buffers.
	
June 10, 2011 10.0-007
	- Add -textheight switch Readout shell to support running
	  in on displays with limited heights.
	
June 22, 2011 10.0-008
	- Add --deleteonexit switch to stdintoring
	- CRemoteAccess - modify to start stdintoring with --deleteonexit
	  so that the proxy ring is deleted if the remote part of the
	  hoisting pipeline dies.
July 8, 2011 10.0-009
	- Extend length of getpwbyuid buffer in CReadoutMain.cpp it was
	only marginally good for some people with small gecos fields.
August 5, 2011 10.0-010
	- Remove extraneous -lpub from daqstart's Makefile.am.
October 12, 2011 10.0-011
	Fixes for defects in readout framework found when getting CAESAR ready:
	- SBS Makefile did not honor USERCXXFLAGS, USERCCFLAGS nor
 	  USERLDFLAGS support was added in a way that ensures that
	  USERCCFLAGS and USERCXXFLAGS may differ but nonetheless
	  factoring out the common flagsets.
	- Add -D's  to the Makefiel includes so that users accessing VME
	  classes get the fact that we have a mapped interface.
	- Add missing #define __CREADOUTMAIN_H to CReadoutMain.h
	- Fix error in CAENV262Busy - defined GoReady rather than GoClear
	  so it became an abstract class.  Fixed while retaining the
	  GoReady function because we know the workaround kludge/fix won't
	  disappear.
	- Call clear on main scaler bank in CExperiment after the readout
	  so scaler don't continuously increment
	* Work around issues with the documentation getting too big for 
	  docbook2dvi (it segfaults)...by generating man pages and 
	  htmldocs only.
        - Turn off driver tracing in CVMEInterface::Read. oops
	- Lock/unlock VME Interface in trigger main loop for some dwell
	  time.
	- Fix broken -p switch in tcl server.
	- Clear scalers and readout hardware much later in the
 	  initialization game.
	- Fix time handling for scaler reads.
October 17, 2011 10.0-012
	- Move begin run emit to just prior to starting the 
	  atual run itself...so we're not timing the hardware
	  initialization.

October 18, 2011 10.0-013	
	- Stop using run state time for anything but keep computing each
	from 'now' and start stamp.
October 18, 2011 10.0-014
	- Use ns resolutino realtime clock for all CExperiment timing
	to try to get better synch with the scaler trigger clock.
	- Fix error in CRingSelectionPredicate...would not allow the last
	ring item to be fetched until more were in the ring.
October 18, 2011 10.0-015
	- Pull in up to date scaler display program from 8.2..which
	diverged after this forked off.
October 21, 2011 10.0-016
	- Fix Packet/Vpacket macros so that they generate compatibility
	  (word size-field) packets not checking for jumbo-bufferness.
October 24, 2011 10.0-017
	- Add memory barriers on shm operations that write to ensure
	everthing is flushed to shm. - gcc specific code.
	- Add a bit of a safety zone between get/put pointers.
	- Go to a two phase client allocation: first set pid - 0
	  which makes it ineligible for size computation, and claims it
	  for use.  Then set the get pointer and finally set the PID to
	  the actual value making it elligible for size computation.
Nobvember 4, 2011 10.0-018
	- Deal a bit better with pointer skew that can happen as new
	  consumers enter the fray.
	- Play with the tkdumper help file...fix missing link.
	- Provide migration tutorial.
	
November 4, 2011 10.0-019
	- Make stdintoring understand that data are structured not a
	stream.
November 7, 2011 10.0-020
	- If a proxy ring has no producer then restart the pipeline if a
	client attaches.  This provides a way to recover from remote
	system reboot that's much saner.
        - If a ring is deleted then kill its clients.
	- If a get/put/peek operations discoveres the client's PID has
	been co-opted by some other process or released, throw a state
	exception and refuse to perform the operation.  This deals with an
	edge case that should not happen...however better safe than sorry
	especially since the cost is negligible.
	- Require stdintoring have at least a full header in putData
	else the remainder is a residual.
	- Use same run time offset algorithm as scalers for variable dump
	bufs.
November 9-16, 2011 10.0-021
	- Add --exitonend option to ringselector (WO W00957).

	  logger.
	- Add spectcldaq script that provides an 8.2 compatible SpecTcl
   	  data source.
	- Add spectcldaq.server - Tcp/IP script that provides 8.2
	  compatible hoist of events out to a non daq system.
	- Support using the EVENTLOGGER env varible to select the event
	  logging program.
	- Provide docs for the compatibility mode utilities in the
	  utilities sections of the general docs and its own section of
	  reference docs (1compatibility).
  	- Add compatibility docs to the ring migration tutorial.
	
November 16-18, 2011 10.0-022
	- Explicitly use ssh not rsh in the rsh package of
	  ReadoutShell.
	- Add complete docs for the readout GUI.
November 21-23 2011 10.0-023
	- Introductory docs for the grand unified documentation begun.
	- Fix 2 stupidities in ringtostdout when writes needed to be
	  segmented, both the wrong pointer and wrong count were used in
	  subsequent writes.
	- Fix copy problem in stdintoring -when residual was less than a
	  header the residual was not being moved resulting in corrupted
	  events, hangs and crashes.
	- Remove misguided changes to Ring predicates that were supposed
  	  to  improve sampling case...they actually killed sampling.
	
10.0-024:
November 24-Dec 1, 2011
	- Completed introductory section of comprehensive docs.
	- Fixed error in stdintoring that would not flush the input buffer
	  completely.
	- Fixed error in stdintoring that re-declared the remainnig bytes
	  value which had the bad effect of it never being initialized
	  from the point of view of the code that needed it initalized.
	- Incorporate Dirk's suggestions into the Ring buffer tutoria.

10.0-25
December 7, 2011
	- In ring selection predicates don't block between skips as these
	  can happen quickly.
December 8, 2011
	- Don't delete ring anymore when feeder exits as the code now
	  alows it to be restarted (CRemoteAccess.cpp). 
	- Support the RINGNAME environment variable to set the ring we use
	  in the remote system for eventlog and sclclient.
        - If the ring specified in a URL has a host that maps to the
	  host' localname don't create a proxy ring but connect to the
	  local ring. e.g. if I'm on charlie.nscl.msu.edu and 
	  specify tcp://charlie/fox I'll connect to tcp://localhost
December 12, 2011
	- Truncate long title strings in sbs/readout/CExperiment rather
	  than causing CRingStateChangeItem to throw a range exception.
	- Add title string validation so that users cannot actually enter
	  strings longer than 80 characters..so they are not surprised
 	  that their strings get truncated.

	                checking for a good stagearea link.
	- Attempt to fix race condition between the s800 start and the
	  polling of the s800 status.

	  Daniel B. and Scott W.
	- Turn it back off due to the potential of users to have to
	  respond to a dialog on the s800 control panel.
	- In S800 exit handler deal with the fact that the S800 may have
	  exited so socket transactions with/to it may fail....correct

	- Issue #1195 deal with S800 bozo-ness on scalers.
	- Ensure readoutGUI starts with correct colors.
10.1-005
	- Issue #1195 - Provide visual indication that runs are
	  starting/stopping.
	- Now that there is bandwidth and hopefully users are aware of the
	  problems turn s800 record crate files _back_ on by default.
	  Seems like they really just need the damned settings most of the
	  time but they are not capable of separating the two somehow.
10.1-006

10.1-100
	- Add timestamped nonincr scaler item
	- In BufferToRing emit both scaler and nonincr scaler items to the
	s800 ring.  The concept there is that we can feed the timestamped
	items to Gretina so that they get properly sorted.
	- Debugged issues with the VMUSB Tcl stuff.
	- Decided how to get pkgIndex to really work properly for lib.
	 where some .so's may have dependencies based on the enclosing
	app.

10.2
	- Issue #1174 - Create development branch for nscldaq-10.2 with
	the event builder (July 2, 2012).
	- Issue #1193 - Factor the socket library used by epics and vmusb
	  into a base library so it can be used by the event builder
	  client libraries.
	- Add timestamp based event builder to the software.
        - Add stock fragment sources for ring buffers:
	  * Generic source
	  * S800 source
	  * Gretina source.
	- Factored out the various read/write loopy functions -> base/os
	 (Issue #1417

	building.
	- Issue #1521 - Provide mechanism to uniquify event orderer
	instances and name them.
	- Issue #1522 - Provide mechanism to contact named event orderer
	and to specify the name of an orderer in the ring fragment data
	source.
	- Issue #1523 - ringFragmentSource secures its timestamp extractor
	by actually mapping a temp copy.
	-Provide CEventSegment in sbs/Readout with the following methods:
	    reject -Rejects the event afer running all subsequent event
	            segments.
	    rejectImmediately - Rejects without running any more event
	            segments.
	    keep - Keep the event unless a subsequent event segment
	           invokes one of the above.  Note that normally keep
	           is called by the event segment's caller to user event
	           segments only need to invoke this if they've initially
	           decided to reject(Immeditely) and then changed their
	           mind e.g.:
	            reject();

	- Catch up on missing documentation for:
	  *  teering
	  *  glom
	  *  readout callouts package for the event builder.

	- Issue #1147 - Refactor various whoami's to os-specific code and
	  replace locally defined methods and functions with calls to the
	  centralized one.
        - Issue #1219 - Refactor various uri based file/ring opens into
  	  a factory object.

	- Some clean up of dead code.
        - Ensure SBSReadout exits when stdin gets lost.
	- Migrate the service wait code into the evbcallouts standard script.
        - Let event sources settle before allowing the run to start.
	- In event builder rdo callouts ensure end run will wait longer
	  for the eventlogger to finish since there's much deeper
	  buffering/longer latencies.
	- eventlogger - Fix bad memory leak that happens when the
	  first item seen is not a begin run (of course the stuff above
	  among other things tries to prevent this).
10.2-005

10.2-103
	Merged in other 10.2 branches.
10.2-104
	* Added m4 tests for swig, cppunit, epics, gengetopt and tcl.
	* Modified configure.ac to use m4 based tests above.
	* Added support for Jenkins CI build system (script to locate,
	unpack and build/test from tarball.
	* Use centralized tclplus library (if installed from .deb. use
	that else pull in a local copy from tcllib directory, see
	tcl++incorp script in top level directory to pull that library in
	from an svn tag.  Note as well that tcllib is an EXTRA_DIST so
	that it winds up in the tarball.
	* Fix error in daq/format/ringitem.c - itemsize is using unsigned
	arithmetic so we want to be sure that we're never getting negative
	size components.
	* Remove EPICS unit tests since they are specific to NSCL
	Environment and therefore won't run for other installers.
	* Add definition of gpTCLApplication to the swigized VMUSB
	library so that it can be used in standalone mode too.
	* Fix issues with 64/32bit uncleanliness in vmetcl.
	* Deal with the double def of -lieee in SBSRDO Makefiles -> TCL_LIBS
	  and don't use THREAD_LDFLAGS since tcl builds must be threaded
	for any of this to work.
	* Add missing libs -lSBSDeviceSupport -lSBSVmeAPI to SBSRDO
	makefile include directory. 
        * Fix some sizeof(xxx) 64/32 bit uncleanlinesses in sbs/vmemodules
        * CSIS3820 works now for sure (based on MoNA testing).
	* Added some more SWIG bridges to functions that need non-builtin
	  argument types.
	* Added CSIS3820::ReadHighBits to give support for the 48 bit
	scaler channels.
	* Fix error in event orderer...was not paying attention to the
	buffering window time as such a data source that only emitted
	auto-assigned timestamp events (e.g. scalers) would not allow data
	from the more lively source to be sent out.
        * Fix error in ReadoutGUI - timed runs fail badly if it takes more
        than .5 seconds to end the run.
        * Fix edge case in CRingBuffer::isRing - if there are files in
	/dev/shm that are smaller than a minimal ringbuffer segfaults
	occur.
10.2-105
	* Fiddle around with the build window logic to get the event
	orderer to properly order under weird edge cases.
	* Fix buffer overflow error in stdring (Bug #1916) 
	   *   If a ring item would overflow the buffersize seleted by 
	       --minsize, resize thebuffer.
	   *   If a ring item would not fit in the ring, complain and
	       exit.
	* Fix Issue #1928 - Event orderer GUI was never updating the total
	fragment counter in the UI.
10.2-106
	* Incorporate new VM/CCUSB software additions (Jeromy).
	* Fix error in the build for installing documentation when docbook
	is not installed.

10.2-107
	* Fix for Issue #2035 - See commit of Revision r3517 for
	CFragmentHanlder.cpp in trunk/nextgen/daq/eventbuilder
        * Issue #2035 - use a larger low water mark for time based
	flushing to smooth out the data
