/*!
   An abstract base class for modules that can be read out.
   These modules get associated with configurations that
   they are then able to read.  Modules that can be read out
   are expected to have to do two things:
   - Prepare for activity (initialization).
   - Supply the list of things that need to be done to read them out.

   The controller we are using is a VM-USB controller. While it may
   be acceptable to do initialization via individual operations or a one-shot
   list, performance of the main readout must be done in VM-USB autonomous daq mode.
   The strategy is therefore to provide an initialization entry that is called
   just prior to the readout going active, and another entry which is handed
   the DAQ list.  The module is then supposed to add its contribution to the
   DAQ list.
