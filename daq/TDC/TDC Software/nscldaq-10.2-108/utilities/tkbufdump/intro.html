        <h2>Introduction to tkdumper</h2>
        <p>
            tkdumper is a program that allows you to inspect data from a data
            source in the NSCLDAQ version 10.0 and later (ring buffer data
            distribution systems).  This page orients you to the operation of
            of the dumper as well as pointing you to other help pages you are
            likely to need.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tkdumper window consists of three sections.
            <ul>
                <li>At the top is a menubar.  For information about the
                    menubar menus see the <a href="menus.html">Menus</a>
                    topic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The middle and largest section is the display area.  Events
                    you sample from the data source are formatted and displayed
                    here.  Dumped data are displayed here appropriately
		    formatted.  In the case of event data you can control the
		    formatting by extending the buffer dumper (See below).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The bottom strip is a status bar.  It contains two items. om 
                    The left most section displays the current data source or is
                    empty if you have not connected tot a data source.
                    The right most part of the bar is an arrow button that requests
                    an event from the data source.
                    For more information on this button, see the
                    <a href="next.html">Get Next Event</a> topic..
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            The tkdumper understands the general format of NSCL event buffers.
            Specifically it understands that events are divided into packets,
            it understands a set of defined packet ids, the format of a packet.
            You an also
            <a href="extend.html">extend tkdumper</a> to add packets to the known
            packet list and to describe how packets should be formatted.
