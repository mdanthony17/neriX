        <h2>Packet formatting plugins</h2>
        <p>
            By default, the body of a known packet type is formatted as a block
            of hexadecimal digits.  It is possible to format packet body data
            differently (for example detector numbers and component values can
            be labeled).  The mechanism for doing this is a plugin.
        </p>
        <p>
            Plugins are Tcl scripts that are loaded via the
            <tt>File->Plugin...</tt> menu command.  That commands prompts for a
            Tcl file which is then sourced into the application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Packet body formatters are Tcl <tt>proc</tt>s.  The procs must be
            registered with the event formatter.  Registration binds the proc to
            a specific packet id.  When registered, the proc is invoked for
            each occurence of that packet id and passed the body of the packet as
            a parameter.  The proc is expected to return the text it wishes inserted
            into the event display for that packet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The event formatter base code will already describe the packet
            based on the information in the
            <a href="packet.html">Packet definition</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Packet body formatters are registerd by invoking
            <tt>proc registerPacketFormatter {id fmtcmd}</tt>  where
            the parameters of this function are
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dd>id</dd><dt>The id of the packet to which to bind this formatter</dt>
            <dd>fmtcmd</dd><dt> The name of the packet formatting proc.
            </dt>
        </dl>
        <p>
            Here is a sample plugin for the 0x8000 packet and its registration.
        </p>
        <tt><pre>
 # Plugin to format 0x8000 packets:
    #
    proc format8000 body {   
        set result "Hex   Decimal   Octal\n"
        foreach item $body { 
        append result [format "0x%04x %05d %06o\n" $item $item $item]
    }
    return $result           
    }
    registerPacketFormatter 0x8000 format8000 
          </pre></tt>
