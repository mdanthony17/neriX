        <h2>The tkdumper menubar</h2>
        <p>
            The tkdumper menubar at he very top of the application provides access to the commands you can give
            the program.   There are three menus in the menubar:
            <ul>
                <li>File</li>
                <li>Filter</li>
                <li>Help</li>
        <h3>The File menu</h3>
        <p>
            The file menu offers the following commands:
            <ul>
                <li>Open... - this command opens a dialog that allows you to
                    connect tkdumper to an event source.  Until this is done,
                    the application is not able to display events.
                    For more information on the Open command, see the
                    <a href="open.html">Open</a> dialog's context sensitive help.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Packet Defs... - this command opens a file chooser dialog.
                        Use this dialog to select a file that contains packet
                        definitions.   For more information about the format
                        of this file see
                        <a href='packet.html'>packet definition files</a>.
                        Once read, a packet definition file extends the set
                        of packet types that are recognized and formatted as
                        packets in physics events.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Plugin... - this command opens a file chooser dialog.
                    Use this dialog to select a file that contains plugin Tcl
                    code.   Plugin code can be used to format packets in physics
                    events in whatever manner you choose.  For more information
                    see <a href='plugin.html'>Plugin Code</a>.
                </li>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>The Filter menu</h3>
        <p>
            The filter menu provides the following commands:
            <ul>
                <li>Filter Types... - allows you to specify a data type filter.
                    data type filters restrict the set of event types that will
                    be displayed when you request a sample.  Clicking this menu
                    item will bring up a dialog that prompts for the filter specification.
                    <a href="filter.html">Filter dialog context sensitive help</a>
                    provides information about this dialog.
                </li>
                <li>Remove Filter - Removes any defined filter.</li>
