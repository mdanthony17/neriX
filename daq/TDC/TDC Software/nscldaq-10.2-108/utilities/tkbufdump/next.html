        <h2>Getting the next event</h2>
        <p>
        In order to display an event you must click the <tt>next event button</tt>.
        This button is a right arrow button at the lower right corner of the tkdumper
        window.  Each time you click this button, tkdumper increments a
        "samples requested" value.
        </p>
        <p>
            When an event is received, it is matched against whatever filter
            condition has been set.  If the event matches the filter condition,
            and the "samples requested " value is greater than zero, the sample is
            formatted and displayed and the "samples requested" value is decremented.
