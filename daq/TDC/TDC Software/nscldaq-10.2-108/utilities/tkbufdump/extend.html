        <h2>Extending tkdumper</h2>
        <p>
            The tkdumper program supports dynamic extension.  Dynamic extension
            means that the functionality of the program can be extended while it
            is running.  This is possible because the program is completely written
            in Tcl/Tk.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following can be extended:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="packet.html">Packet definitions</a> - Additional packet
                types can be made known to tkdumper by using the
                <tt>File->Packet Defs...</tt> menu command to read in a packet
                definition.  Follow the link above to see what the format of a
                packet definition file is.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="plugin.html">Plugin packet formatters</a> - The body of a
                packet can be formatted in whatever way you want by loading and
                registering packet formatting plugins.  Plugins are loaded via
                the <tt>File->Plugin...</tt> menu command.  To see how to write a
                packet formatting plugin, follow the link above.
