        <h2>Packet definition files</h2>
        <p>
            While the body of a physics event is completely up to the data source,
            by convention most data source programs segment each event into packets.
        </p>
        <p>
            A packet is a self describing segment of an event. The form of a packet
            consists of:
        </p>
        <tt><pre>
+------------------------------+
| Packet size in uint32_t      |
+------------------------------+
| uint16_t packet id           |
+------------------------------+
| Packet body.                 |
     ...
+------------------------------+
        </pre>
        </tt>
        <p>
            In the figure above, the packet size is the number of 16 bit words in
            the packet and includes itself as well as the packet id.  The packet
            id is a 16 bit value that uniquely identifies the packet.  A
            packet assignment authority at the NSCL allocates packet ids on request.
            In addition the range of packet ids starting with 0x8000 and going to
            0xffff is currently unassigned.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tkdumper application understands the packet structure of physics
            events and will attempt to break up the event into known packets indicating
            which packets are present and dumping the body of each packet separately.
        </p>
        <p>
            If tkdumper encounters an uknown packet type it will simply dump the
            remainder of the event under the assumption the remainder of the event may
            not be in actual packets.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the <tt>File->Packet Defs...</tt>  menu entry, you can add to
            the set of packet definitions recognized by tkdumper.
            <tt>File->Packet Defs...</tt> prompts for a packet definition file and
            then loads it into its packet definition dictionary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Packet definition files are text files.  Each line of the file
            describes a single packet.  The description is a set of space
            separated fields.  If a field has embedded whitespace it can be either
            quoted with double quotes or placed inside curly brackets.
            The fields in order are:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dd>Short Name</dd><dt> A short name for the packet (usually a single word).</dt>
            <dd>Packet id</dd><dt> The id of the packet.  This can be any numerical
            representation recognized by Tcl.
            </dt>
            <dd>Long Name</dd><dt>A long descriptive name for the packet.  This
            is usually several words.
            </dt>
            <dd>Version</dd><dt>A string that provides versioning information for
            the packet.
            </dt>
        </dl>

        <p>
            The line below defines a packet with the id 0x792 that is a test
            packet with version 1.0:
        </p>
        <tt><pre>
Test    0x792   {Ring buffer test packet} 1.0
