        <h2>Opening a data source</h2>
        <p>
            This dialog allows you to open a data source for the tkdumper program.
            Two data items are required and should be filled in in the dialog above:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dd>Host:</dd> <dt> This is the computer that is the source of
                data for tkdumper.  The default is <tt>localhost</tt> which is
                the system on which you are running tkdumper.</dt>
            <dd>User:</dd> <dt>This is the username of the account that is running
                the readout program on the host computer.  This defaults to the
                name of the user running tkdumper.</dt>
        </dl>
        <p>
            Fill in the two entries (usually you will only need to modify the
            Host field). And:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click Ok to accept and connect to that data source.</li>
            <li>Click Cancel to dismiss this dialog and do nothing.</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
