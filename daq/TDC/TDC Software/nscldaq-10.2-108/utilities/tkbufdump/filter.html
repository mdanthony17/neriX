        <h2>Creating a data filter</h2>
        <p>
            Typically the data coming from a readout program is dominated by
            physics events.  This can make it hard to see other types of events
            if this is desired. Type filters allow you to select which event
            types are displayed when requesting to see a new event.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dialog allows you to specify both the standard event types and
            any user defined event types you might have created.
        </p>
        <p>
            To add a standard event type to the set of accepted event types,
            either highlight it in the <tt>Item Types</tt> list box and click
            the right arrow or double click the item in the <tt>Item Type</tt>
            listbox.  Custom event types can be added by id number.  To do this type
            the ID number in the <tt>User ItemType</tt> entry box and click the
            <tt>Add</tt> button.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have accidently added an even type to the <tt>Selected Item types</tt>
            list you can remove it.  Either select the item in the <tt>Selected
            Item types</tt> list box  and click the
            left arrow button or double click the item type in the
            <tt>Selected Item types</tt> listbox.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you are done:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click OK to apply the filter described in the
            <tt>Selected Item types</tt> box
            </li>
            <li>Click Cancel to dismiss the dialog without doing anything.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Filters can be removed via the <tt>Filter->RemoveFilter</tt>
            menu command.
        </p>
