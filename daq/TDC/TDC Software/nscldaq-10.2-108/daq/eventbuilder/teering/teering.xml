           <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
           <para>
            <application>teering</application> is similar to the Unix
            <application>tee</application> program.  Where
            <application>tee</application> takes its standard input and
            outputs it to a file as well as its standard output,
            <application>teering</application>takes as input ringbuffer items,
            and outputs them both to a ring buffer and standard output.
           </para>
           <para>
            The intent of <application>teering</application> is to provide
            you with the ability to create test points along the path of a
            pipeline that transforms data from one set of ring items to another.
            A sample use of teering is to provide a test point for the ordered
            event fragments emitted from the event orderer before
            <application>glom</application> is used to build events.
           </para>
           <para>
            <application>teering</application> has a single command option
            that is required: <option>--ring</option>'s argument provides the
            name of the ring into which <application>teering</application> will
            output data.
           </para>
