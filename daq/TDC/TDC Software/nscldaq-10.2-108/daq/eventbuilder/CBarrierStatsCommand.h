/**
 * @class CBarrierStatsCommand
 *
 *   This class implements the 'barrierstats' command. 
 *   The command fetches statistics about the barriers fragments
 *   that have been processed by the event orderer.  The output of this
 *   is a two element list.  The first element of the list provides
 *   the statistics for complete barriers.  The second element provides
 *   the statistics for incomplete barriers.
 *
 *   Command format:
 *
 * \code{.tcl}
 *     barrierstats
 * \endcode
 *   Complete barrier statistics are in turn a list with the following elements:
 *   - number of complete barriers processed.
 *   - number of complete homogeneous barriers.
 *   - number of complete heterogeneous barriers.
 *   - Number of barrier fragments of each type.  This is a list where each element contains
 *     + A barrier type.
 *     + The number of barriers of that type seen.
 *   - Statistics by event source, which is a list, where each element is:
 *     + Source id.
 *     + Barrier fragments from that source.
 *     + List describing the fragments of each type from this source:
 *        - Barrier fragment type.
 *        - Number of that type
 *  
 *  Incomplete barrier statistics are also a list containingthe following elements:
 *  - Number of incomplete barriers.
 *  - Number of homogeneous incomplete barriers.
 *  - Number of heterogeneous incomplete barriers.
 *  - histogram showing how many sources were missing, this is represented as a list where each
 *    list element is a pair:
 *    +  n
 *    +  Number of times n sources were missing from the barrier.
 *  - Source statstics.  This is a list containing:
 *    + Source id.
 *    + Number of times the source was missing from a barrier.
