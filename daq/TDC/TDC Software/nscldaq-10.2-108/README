NSCLDAQ-10.0 throws away spectrodaq as the data distribution server, replacing
it with a set of ring buffers and their proxies.

See http://docs.nscl.msu.edu/daq for documentation including how to 
port existing software from older versions of NSCLDAQ as well
as how to hook in your SpecTcl data analysis software.

To build unwrap the tarball cd to the directory it creates and

./configure --prefix=where-it-goes {other options}

make install

prior to doing this you'll want to 
./configure --help 

The specific switches you may want are:

--enable-sbs=kernel-source-dir - build support for the SBS VME interface
                                 kernel-source-dir contains a configured
                                 kernel source tree.
--enable-epics-tools=yes | no - enable/disabel the build of some EPICS
                                tools.
--with-epics-rootdir=epicsinstall-dir - Helps the epic tools locate EPICS
                                support software at build time.
